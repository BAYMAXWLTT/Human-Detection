# Human-Detection

## INTRODUCTION:
Implemented a human detection algorithm by using histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) features and a linear support vector machine(SVM) classifier.Goal is to generate bounding boxes for each human in static images. Entire model is implemented with the help of NumPy and scikit-learn libraries. In order to train the model, the data is taken from Inria's person dataset, which contains 2,416 positive 64 Ã— 128 images.The negative images are also from same dataset, for each non-pedestrian image, 10 random windows of 64 x 128 pixels were extracted for training, giving a total of 12,180  negative images. This trained model was then used to test the detection accuracy on test images.

## TECHNICAL DETAILS:
Using the approach described by Dalal and Triggs, the HOG features are extracted from both positive and negative training images. According to this approach each image is divided in to overlapping blocks and each block is further divided in to cells which will be used to extract one-dimensional histogram of oriented edge magnitudes for entire pixels of a cell. The block sizes can be 2 x 2, 4 x 4 or 8 x 8 and the cell size can 8 x 8 and 16  x 16. All the different combinations were tried to get best results.
The feature vectors extracted from the images were used to train linear SVM classifier. The trained SVM classifier(preliminary model) is used to detect humans on negative images over a sliding window of size 64  x 128. All the false positives obtained by using the preliminary model were combined with initial set of negative images and using the updated set of training images a new SVM model is obtained. The secondary SVM model reduces false positive rate by a lot. 

## BOUNDING BOX and NON MAXIMA SUPPRESSION:
The sliding window and the images which we trained our model is of fixed size 64 x 128, but a human can appear at variuos scaled in an image depending on the distance of the object from the lens. Hence a scale space image pyramid is constructed and sliding window is passed across each image in the scale space. Whenever a true positive is detected, we record the coordinates of bounding box but a single human can lead to multiple true positives i.e multiple bounding boxes at variuos scales. In order to avoid this, Non Maxima Suppression is performed on bounding boxes that overlap by a certain percentage and one among these were chosen based on scores.
