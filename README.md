# Human-Detection

INTRODUCTION:
Implemented a human detection algorithm by using histogram of Oriented Gradients(HOG) features and a linear support vector machine(SVM) classifier.Goal is to generate bounding boxes for each human in static images. Entire model is implemented with the help of NumPy and scikit-learn libraries. In order to train the model, the data is taken from Inria's person dataset, which contains 2,416 positive 64 Ã— 128 images.The negative images are also from same dataset, for each non-pedestrian image, 10 random windows of 64 x 128 pixels were extracted for training, giving a total of 12,180  negative images. This trained model was then used to test the detection accuracy on test images.
